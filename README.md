# About
A simple ‘to do list’ app with the ability to mark items as completed or delete them.

# Features
- Click to mark item as complete
- Swipe to delete item

# Compatibility
This project is written in Swift 5.0 and Xcode 11.4. It has been tested and works on an iPhone 11 running ios 12.4. It will work on other devices but the layout has not been optimized for them yet.
